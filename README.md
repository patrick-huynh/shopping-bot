First, you must install some libraries


1) The first being the requests library which is what we use to get the HTML page:
      **pip install requests**

2) The second library is the beautiful soup library which is good for parsing HTML:
      **pip install beautifulsoup4**
      
3) We will be using the Twillo library to send a notification to our phone when the item is in stock:
      **pip install twilio**
